Avoiding the details of the major pathways of energy production (such as glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation), this lesson is focused exclusively on ATP, which is truly the fuel of life. Starting with the discovery and history of ATP, this lesson will walk the students through 8 segments (outlined below) interspersed by 7 in-class challenge questions and activities, to the final step of ATP production by the ATP synthase, an amazing molecular machine. A basic understanding of the components and subcellular organization (e.g. organelles, membranes, etc.) and chemical foundation (e.g. biomolecules, chemical equilibrium, biochemical energetics, etc.) of a eukaryotic cell is a desired prerequisite, but it is not a must. Through interactive in-class activities, this lesson is designed to spark the students\u2019 interest in biochemistry and human biology as a whole, but could serve as an introductory lesson to teaching advanced concepts of metabolism and bioenergetics in high school depending on the local science curriculum.

The lesson will present creative and challenging ideas on the topic of alternative energies. It is hoped that students will be inspired by the introduction of these ideas, and that they will develop the confidence to come up with creative ideas themselves. Background for this lesson is based on fundamental concepts in chemistry (mainly), biology, physics and environmental science. The lesson can be completed in a 50-60 minute class and includes 6 segments, with a challenging activity for the students between segments. These activities will take almost half of the time, approximately 20-25 minutes, with the students working in groups of 2-4. The students should discuss the challenging questions and exchange ideas with each other, and be ready for the next segment."}

It is designed to develop and optimize learning/teaching strategies to help students understand these two difficult concepts. The key learning objective is to help students understand that \u201camount of substance\u201d is used as a bridge to connect the invisible micro world to the observable macro world. The materials for the students\u2019 activities are simple and easily obtained, such as beans, kitchen scales, a stack of paper, a ruler and some chemicals that are common in chemistry labs. Teachers can always make changes and prepare the materials according to what they have in their schools. This lesson is designed for two class sessions and each class session is about 45-50 minutes. Before beginning this lesson, students should have prerequisite knowledge about atoms and atomic structure, including the concepts of isotopes and relative atomic mass. They should also know the composition of matter and the meaning of a chemical equation. In addition, they should know how to express a number in scientific notation.\nThis two-part lesson, along with two other BLOSSOMS lessons, can be used to present a teaching unit on Amount of Substance and Mole. We suggest that the four lessons be used in the following sequence:\n\n Amount of Substance and Its Unit - Mole: Part 1; \nHow Big Is a Mole: Do We Really Understand Avogadro\u2019s Number?; \nAmount of Substance and Its Unit - Mole: Part 2; \nStoichiometry."}

Overall, the lesson will take about 45-55 minutes. During the first two breaks, the class will list their preconceptions about chemical reactions and then experience an exciting reaction which is produced inside a re-sealable plastic bag. The chemicals needed for this reaction are sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride. After this excitement, the video will show how to separate the mixture to demonstrate the existence of the new products, which include sodium chloride, CO2 and chalk. The separation can be completed by the classroom teacher as well at a later time. In the third break, the teacher will write out the balanced chemical equation and the class will account for the same number of atoms on each side of the equation, demonstrating the conservation of mass. In the fourth break, students will have time to model the atoms chemical reaction using LEGO\u00ae bricks as the atoms or by using atoms made from clay or homemade play dough. Lastly, the video will apply the definition of chemical reaction to analyze a scene where a cork explodes from a heated liquid in a test tube."}

The experiments take some time. To save time, the students can be divided into several groups with 3-5 students doing different experiments. Afterwards, the different groups can share and discuss their findings. By conducting the experiements this way, the lesson can be done in about 45 minutes. Students should be encouraged to perform the experiments in a focussed and ordered manner.

With programming, the solution to a particular problem lies in the head, but one is unable to convert it into a computer program. This is because the thought processes of a human are much faster than the sense of observation. If this thought process could be slowed down, logic to solve a programming problem could be found very easily. This lesson focuses on converting this psychological thought process in a step-by -step logic fashion that a computer program can understand. This lesson is recorded in a kitchen where the basic programming concepts are taught by giving examples from the process of making a mango milk shake. This lesson teaches the 4 following techniques: 1) Swapping two variables by swapping a glass of milk with a glass of crushed ice; 2) Finding max from an array by finding the biggest mango; 3) Sorting an array by arranging the jars; and 4) Understanding the concept of a function, parameters and return type by comparing it with the blender/juicer. The lesson targets those students who know the syntax of programming in any language (C or GWBASIC preferred), but are unable to build the logic for a program. It can be taught in a class of 45 to 50 minutes."}

    "update": {"description": "In this video lesson, the concept of momentum applied to hard-body collisions is explained using a number of simple demonstrations, all of which can be repeated in the classroom. Understanding Newton's Laws is fundamental to all of physics, and this lesson introduces the vital concepts of momentum and energy, and their conservation. Only some preliminary ideas of algebra are used here, and all the concepts presented can be found in any high-school level physics book. In terms of materials required, getting hold of large steel balls may not be easy, but large ball bearings can be procured easily. On the basis of what students have learned in the video, teachers can easily generate a large number of questions that relate to one's daily experiences, or which pose new challenges: for example, in a collision between a heavy and light vehicle, why do those inside the heavier one suffer less injury?"}

    "update": {"description": "This lesson introduces students to the concepts of evolution, specifically the evolution of humans. So often our students assume that humans are well adapted to our environments because we are in control of our evolutionary destiny. The goal is to change these types of misconceptions and get our students to link the concepts learned in their DNA, protein synthesis, and genetics units to their understanding of evolution. Students will also discover that humans are still evolving and learn about the traits that are more recent adaptations to our environment. The lesson is designed to take two one-hour class periods to complete. The activities will allow students to draw connections between environmental pressures and selected traits, both through data analysis and modeling. Most activities can be done without any special materials, although the Modeling Natural Selection activity needs either a tri-colored pasta, or tricolored beans, to be completed effectively."}
